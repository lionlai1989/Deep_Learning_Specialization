# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This page comprises a comprehensive collection of materials for the course of [Deep Learning Specialization, Coursera/DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), including my own solutions to the practice problems and personal notes accumulated during the course. It serves as an invaluable resource for me, aiding in developing a solid foundation for my learning journey in deep learning.

## Description
The Deep Learning Specialization explores fundamental principles in deep learning and is divided into five series courses, each offering thorough explanation and unique insights into this dynamic field. In the following sections, I summarize each course with a brief introduction and illustrative figures.
