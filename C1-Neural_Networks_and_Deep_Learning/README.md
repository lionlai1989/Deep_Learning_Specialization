# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

The course, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, provides a comprehensive introduction to the key concepts and fundamentals necessary to start delving into deep learning. What makes this course truly remarkable is that I was able to develop a deep neural network from scratch without relying on any machine learning framework. That's correct! By utilizing Numpy, I successfully implemented a neural network capable of classifying images into cat and non-cat categories.

## Description
This section provides a concise summary of each assignment in the course, accompanied by brief descriptions and a few figures.

- W2A1: [Python Basics with Numpy](https://github.com/lionlai1989/Deep_Learning_Specialization/blob/master/C1-Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning/W2A1-Python_Basics_with_Numpy/Python_Basics_with_Numpy.ipynb)

  It helps me familiarize myself with various fundamental concepts in deep learning, such as the exponential function, sigmoid function and its derivative, softmax function, L1 and L2 loss functions, and more.
  
- W2A2: [Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset](https://github.com/lionlai1989/Deep_Learning_Specialization/blob/master/C1-Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning/W2A2-Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_Mindset/Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb)

  Logistic regression can be viewed as a shallow neural network with no hidden layers. I constructed a shallow neural network without any hidden layers to perform image classification, specifically distinguishing between cat and non-cat images. The implementation encompassed both forward and backward propagation, as well as inference.
