# Structuring Machine Learning Projects
The third course of the Deep Learning Specialization demonstrates how to lead successful machine learning projects and diagnose errors in ML systems. Now, I know how to prioritize error reduction strategies, handle mismatched training/test sets and complex ML settings, and achieve human-level performance.  

What I really like about this course is that Andrew shares his many years of expertise in building deep learning products. After finishing this course, I feel like I am standing on a giant's shoulder.  

## Description

This section provides a concise summary of the course.  

- W1: ML Strategy  
Streamline and optimize ML production workflow by implementing strategic guidelines for goal-setting and applying human-level performance to help define key priorities.  

- W2: ML Strategy  
Develop time-saving error analysis procedures to efficiently evaluate the most promising options, gain intuition on data splitting, and when to utilize multi-task, transfer, and end-to-end deep learning approaches given different amounts of data.
