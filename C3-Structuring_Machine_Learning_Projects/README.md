# Structuring Machine Learning Projects
The third course of the Deep Learning Specialization teaches you how to lead successful machine learning projects and diagnose errors in ML systems. You'll prioritize error reduction strategies, handle mismatched training/test sets and complex ML settings, and achieve human-level performance. The course covers end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

Ideal for learners with basic machine learning knowledge, this course leverages Andrew Ng's expertise in building deep learning products. If you aspire to be a technical leader in AI and steer AI teams, this course provides valuable industry experience.

## Description

This section provides a concise summary of the course.

- W1: ML Strategy  
Streamline and optimize your ML production workflow by implementing strategic guidelines for goal-setting and applying human-level performance to help define key priorities.  

- W2: ML Strategy  
Develop time-saving error analysis procedures to efficiently evaluate the most promising options and gain intuition on data splitting, as well as when to utilize multi-task, transfer, and end-to-end deep learning approaches.
